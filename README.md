# Braninfuck CPU for FPGA

This repository contains a source code and desing of the CPU processing the Brainfuck code in FPGA. 

* Development board [CYC1000](https://shop.trenz-electronic.de/en/Products/Trenz-Electronic/CYC1000-Intel-Cyclone-10/)
* Languages - VHDL, Bluespec

You can use the [Bluespec Compiler Docker](https://github.com/benycze/bsc-docker-container) for the translation of the Bluespec code if you don't want to install it inside your live system.

The project is using the following open-source libraries:

* <https://github.com/jakubcabal/uart-for-fpga> - project with the implementation of the UART module which allows communication between PC and FPGA core
